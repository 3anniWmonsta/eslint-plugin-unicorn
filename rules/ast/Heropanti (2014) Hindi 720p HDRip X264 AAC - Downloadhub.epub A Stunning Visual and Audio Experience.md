Heropanti is a movie that tries to blend romance and action, but fails to impress with its clichÃ©d plot and weak direction. The movie is a remake of the Telugu film Parugu, but does not do justice to the original. The movie relies heavily on Tiger Shroff's charisma and skills, but does not give him a strong character or a convincing story to work with.
 
The movie also suffers from poor editing, dialogues and logic. The movie has many scenes that are either unnecessary or illogical. For example, the scene where Tiger Shroff fights off dozens of goons in a warehouse without getting hurt or tired, or the scene where he escapes from a police station by jumping off a window and landing on a bike. The movie also has many cheesy and corny lines that make you cringe.
 
The movie is not all bad though. The movie has some redeeming features, such as the music, the cinematography and the chemistry between the lead pair. The movie has some catchy and melodious songs that are well picturized and choreographed. The movie also has some beautiful locations and shots that capture the essence of rural India. The movie also has some moments of romance and humor that lighten up the mood.
