Robot Structural Analysis Professional is a software application that performs structural load analysis on various types of structures. It allows you to verify the compliance of your design with the relevant codes and standards, and to optimize it for safety and performance. It also enables you to exchange data seamlessly with Revit, a BIM (Building Information Modeling) software that helps you to design, document, and construct buildings. By using Robot Structural Analysis Professional, you can create more resilient, constructible designs that are accurate, coordinated, and connected to BIM.

Robot Structural Analysis Professional supports a wide range of structural analysis types, such as linear and nonlinear, static and dynamic, buckling and fatigue, seismic and wind, and more. It also supports various materials, such as steel, concrete, wood, aluminum, and composite. You can use it to model complex structures with parametric tools, apply loads and boundary conditions, and generate detailed reports and documentation.
  
Robot Structural Analysis Professional integrates with Revit through a bidirectional link that allows you to transfer data between the two applications. You can import a Revit model into Robot Structural Analysis Professional and perform the analysis on it. You can also export the analysis results and design changes back to Revit and update the model accordingly. This way, you can ensure that your design is consistent and coordinated across different disciplines and stages of the project.

Robot Structural Analysis Professional is part of the Autodesk Architecture, Engineering & Construction Collection, a set of software tools that help you to deliver high-quality projects faster and more efficiently. By using Robot Structural Analysis Professional along with other Autodesk products, such as AutoCAD, Navisworks, and BIM 360, you can benefit from a comprehensive workflow that covers the entire lifecycle of your building project.
