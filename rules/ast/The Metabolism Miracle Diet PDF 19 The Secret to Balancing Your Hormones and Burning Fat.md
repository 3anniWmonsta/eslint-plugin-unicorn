## The Metabolism Miracle Diet is based on the idea that some people have a different type of metabolism
 
According to Kress, there are two types of metabolism: type A and type B. Type A metabolism is the normal one that most people have. It allows you to eat a balanced diet of carbs, protein and fat without gaining weight. Type B metabolism, on the other hand, is a condition that affects about 45% of the population. It makes you more sensitive to carbs and prone to weight gain, cravings, fatigue, diabetes and other health problems. Kress believes that type B metabolism is caused by a genetic defect that impairs the function of your pancreas and liver. These organs are responsible for producing insulin, a hormone that regulates your blood sugar levels. When you eat carbs, your blood sugar rises and your pancreas releases insulin to bring it down. However, if you have type B metabolism, your pancreas overreacts and produces too much insulin. This causes your blood sugar to drop too low, triggering hunger and cravings for more carbs. This cycle repeats itself over time, leading to weight gain and metabolic disorders.
 
## The Metabolism Miracle Diet consists of three phases that aim to reset your metabolism
 
To break this cycle and restore your metabolic balance, Kress designed the Metabolism Miracle Diet in three phases. The first phase is called carb rehab. It lasts for eight weeks and requires you to cut out most carbs from your diet. This is meant to reduce the amount of glucose in your blood and deplete your glycogen stores, which are the stored form of glucose in your liver and muscles. By doing this, you force your body to use fat as an alternative fuel source. Kress warns that you may feel tired and irritable for the first three days of this phase, but this will pass as your body adapts. During this phase, you can eat unlimited amounts of lean protein, vegetables and healthy fats. You can also have up to five grams of net carbs per day from certain foods like nuts, seeds, cheese and cream.
 
The second phase is called transition. It lasts until you reach your goal weight, which may take several months depending on how much you need to lose. In this phase, you gradually reintroduce healthy carbs into your diet in controlled amounts and at specific times. You also learn how to choose low-glycemic carbs, which are carbs that have a mild effect on your blood sugar levels. These include foods like whole grains, fruits, beans and dairy products. You can have up to 11 grams of net carbs per meal or snack in this phase, but only after exercise or at least five hours after your last carb intake.
 
The third phase is called maintenance. It lasts for the rest of your life and allows you to enjoy a more flexible and varied diet without regaining weight. In this phase, you can increase your carb intake to suit your individual needs and preferences. You can also eat any type of carb as long as you follow some basic rules: limit your portion sizes, balance your carbs with protein and fat, avoid refined sugars and processed foods, eat only when hungry and stop when satisfied.
